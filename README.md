<h1>noSQL Challenge</h1>

<p></p>In this activity, we have been contracted by the editors of a fictional food magazine, <em>Eat Safe, Love</em>, to evaluate ratings data from the UK Food Standards Agency. They will use our findings to determine where to focus their efforts in the future.<br/></p>

<h2>Setup and Analysis</h2>
<p>The setup of a MongoDB database, import/updating of data, and analysis can all be found within the Code folder.</p>
<p>The database was populated with the <strong>establishments.json</strong> file found in the Resources folder.</p>
